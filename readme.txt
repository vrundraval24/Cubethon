1. Run the 'cubethon_setup' file.
2. Ignore all the warnings from the Microsoft Defender and click 'Yes' for installation, it will show warnings because the game is not licensed and Publisher(me) is unknown to Microsoft.
3. If setup is stopped by warning like 'It can put your PC at risk' just click 'View More' and then click 'run(install) anyway'.
